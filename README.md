# Capsule Killer 2018
A first-person shooter developed in Unity using C#.
Upon starting the game, a capsule (enemy) will spawn at a random location every 2-5 seconds.
The capsules move towards the player, doing damage upon collision. The player has the ability
to move around using the WASD keys, jump using the space bar, and shoot using the left mouse
button. The goal of the game is to eliminate as many capsules as possible before dying.
The game has a fully functional main menu and pause menu.

Here's a screenshot of the main menu:
