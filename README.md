# Capsule Killer 2018
A first-person shooter developed in Unity using C#.
Upon starting the game, a capsule (enemy) will spawn at a random location every 2-5 seconds.

to move around using the WASD keys, jump using the space bar, and shoot using the left mouse
button. The goal of the game is to eliminate as many capsules as possible before dying.
